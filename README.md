# Tic Tac Toe
Terminal base simple tic tac toe game with bot.
The bot is very bad. Only places 'O' at random position. I should probably write a good bot in future :P

# Bot Development progress
Previous bot was random bot.
## One Layer Bot
 bot is updated bot with whenever it sees a winning move it plays it.

## Two Layer bot
This bot checks whether the player is going to win or not if so then it prevents that by placing
a tile their. Only way to win is to create a fork to the bot :P

# Issue
Uses srand and rand on file bot.c so for windows modification is needed.
